I am [Zaikun ZHANG](https://www.zhangzk.net), a Chinese applied mathematician working on optimization.

In terms of software development, right now I am mainly working on [PRIMA](http://www.libprima.net).
I am also a co-author of [PDFO](https://www.pdfo.net) and [COBYQA](http://www.cobyqa.com), both in
collaboration with [Dr. Tom M. RAGONNEAU](https://ragonneau.github.io).
